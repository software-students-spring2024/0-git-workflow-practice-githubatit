The link that to one of the articles that I really found interesting is https://jacobian.org/2023/nov/16/how-to-build-trust/?ref=refind 





## Opinion

The article mainly talks about the basic nature in the field of Software Engineering in order to gain trust. It all starts with firstly, doing your work right where you are doing your roles effectively, whether it has to do with feedbacks, performance and doing what you are expected to do. Secondly, the importance of communication can not be overlooked upon as providing important information and being transparent with your ideas and opinions is really important in order tot get the best out of a project. Thirdly, the importance of taking charge and also delegating work effectively is really important. Thisi mainly has to do with how well are you able to understand your role and be able to contribute within the boundaries of the expectations, moreover, delagting work in an efficient manner is important in order to get the best out of everyone in the space as this enables more productivity, better understanding and most importantly an overall boost to the workflow of a project. Lastly, amongst other important ideas proposed, I found it really important to highlight the importance of respecting confidentiality. This is regarding the understanding and importance of maintaing the privacy amongst each other to not discuss things that are not supposed to be disclosed as it may affect the work environment and many other essential things that count in making a project great.

## Outside Opinion
# From Jakob Hablitz (jsh9965)

The article talks about trust, team building, and some of other more human aspects of developing software in an industry environment.  I think these are some of the aspects of software engineering that are often overlooked by computer sciece classes as in my experience all my classes focused on the individual developer making individual projects.  This meant very little practice working with a team as one might do in the real world.  However, I am excited to have to the opportunity to do more team-based projects in this class.

Comment from Zhongqian Chen:

Communication between team members and have a proper way of managing your team is definitely an important factor that determines how efficient and successful a software dev project goes. An indie-game in dev right now that I'm interested in called Ratatan updates their progress as articles each month, and I'm surprised to find out that they also update on how they manage their team and what new methods of communication they found out worked well for their team in every update article too. This shows how important this part is to the whole software dev project, and thus needs to be taken care of with caution.

# Comment from Zijie:
The passage underscores the critical role of trust, consistency, and clear communication in fostering effective teamwork and collaboration among team members. In my opinion, teamwork is an indispensable component of any thriving organization, grounded in trust, communication, and collaboration. Trust serves as the bedrock for cohesive teamwork, while transparent communication ensures alignment among all members. Effective teamwork, when executed proficiently, can yield higher productivity, creativity, and problem-solving capabilities, ultimately contributing to achieving shared objectives and cultivating a positive work atmosphere.
